# AI Job Search

An AI-powered job application framework built on [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Set up your profile, monitor Gmail for curated job alerts, evaluate roles with AI agents, and apply to high-fit positions with tailored CVs and cover letters.

## What this is

A structured workflow that turns Claude Code into a full-stack job application assistant. The system monitors Gmail for job alerts from LinkedIn and Indeed, evaluates each posting against your profile, and orchestrates a drafter-reviewer pipeline for applications.

```
/fetch-inbox        evaluate            /apply <url>
  |                     |                   |
  v                     v                   v
Poll Gmail for       Assess fit          Score & recommend
LinkedIn/Indeed      against profile     |
alerts               |                   v
  |                  v               Draft CV + Cover Letter
  v             Present matches       (LaTeX, tailored)
Queue jobs       with fit ratings      |
for review           |                 v
                     v             Reviewer agent critiques
                 Pick a match       -> Revise -> Final output
                 -> /apply
```

The framework encodes career guidance best practices, including structured evaluation criteria, forward-looking cover letter framing, and optional salary benchmarking.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI)
- Python 3.10+
- Gmail account with job alert subscriptions (LinkedIn, Indeed)
- **Optional:** LaTeX distribution with `lualatex` and `xelatex` for CV/cover letter compilation. If you use the `/apply` workflow, you'll need [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/). The CV compiles with `lualatex`; the cover letter compiles with `xelatex` (required by `cover.cls`). If you prefer markdown-only resumes, this is optional.

## Quick start

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
gh repo fork MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search --clone
cd ai-job-search
```

### 2. Set up your profile

```bash
claude
# Then inside Claude Code:
/setup
```

`/setup` offers three paths: read your `documents/` folder if you have one populated (CV PDF, LinkedIn export, diplomas, reference letters, past applications), import a single CV pasted in chat, or walk through an interview. It auto-detects what you have and asks. Documents-folder mode is idempotent and safe to re-run as you add more material; see `documents/README.md` for the layout.

### 3. Monitor job alerts

```bash
/fetch-inbox
```

This polls your Gmail inbox for unread job alerts from LinkedIn and Indeed, fetches the full job descriptions, and presents them with quick fit assessments. High-fit matches are queued for review.

### 4. Apply to a job

```bash
/apply https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1234567890/
```

If the URL can't be fetched, you can paste the job description directly instead:

```bash
/apply <paste the full job description here>
```

This runs the full workflow: evaluate fit, draft CV + cover letter, review with a second agent, revise, and present the final output.

## Other commands

`/fetch-inbox`, `/apply`, and manual job tracking form the core workflow. Additional commands extend it:

- **`/expand`** enriches your profile by scanning public sources you've already linked in it (GitHub repos, portfolio site, Kaggle, Google Scholar) and looking up syllabi for named courses and certifications. Discovered competencies are added to your profile with a source tag. Useful right after `/setup` to surface skills that documents alone don't make explicit.
- **`/upskill`** analyzes the gap between your profile and your tracked job postings (or a single posting via `/upskill <URL>`). Produces a prioritized heatmap of skill gaps and a learning plan with web-searched study resources and time estimates. Useful for career planning between applications.

`/reset` is also available, see [Starting over](#starting-over) below.

## How `/apply` works

The `/apply` command runs a **drafter-reviewer workflow** with mandatory PDF compilation:

1. **Parse** the job posting (URL or text)
2. **Evaluate fit** against your profile (skills, experience, culture, location, career alignment)
3. **Draft** a tailored CV and cover letter in LaTeX
4. **Spawn a reviewer agent** that researches the company and critiques the drafts
5. **Revise** based on the reviewer's feedback
6. **Compile and inspect** both PDFs: lualatex for the CV, xelatex for the cover letter. Claude reads the rendered pages and iterates on the LaTeX until the CV is exactly 2 pages with no orphaned entry titles, and the cover letter is exactly 1 page with the signature visible and fonts consistent.
7. **Present** the final output with a verification checklist

All claims in the CV and cover letter are verified against your actual profile. The system never fabricates skills or experience.

### What makes this workflow different

- **PDF verification loop.** Most LaTeX-resume templates produce "looks fine in the .tex" output that breaks in the PDF: job titles orphan to the next page, cover letters spill onto page 2, bullet fonts silently fall back to the body font. The `/apply` command compiles and visually inspects every PDF and applies targeted fixes (`\needspace`, `\enlargethispage`, font-matching wrappers for list items) until the layout is clean. This runs automatically on every application.
- **Relevance-weighted CV cutting.** When a CV overflows 2 pages, the workflow does not cut mechanically from the "oldest" section. It scores each candidate line by (a) relevance to the target posting, (b) uniqueness in the document, and (c) whether the cover letter depends on it, and cuts the lowest-total-score line first. An older-role bullet that hits posting keywords survives ahead of a recent-role bullet that does not.
- **Drafter-reviewer separation.** The drafter writes; a second Claude agent, spawned with a fresh context, researches the company and critiques the drafts. The drafter then revises. This catches missed keywords, weak framing, and generic language that a single pass often leaves in.
- **Token-efficient reviewer dispatch.** The reviewer agent receives drafts inline rather than re-reading them, and the verification checklist runs once at the end of the workflow rather than being duplicated by both agents. Note: the compile-and-inspect step in Step 6 spends some of those savings on PDF rendering and layout iteration — the workflow trades some end-to-end token cost for a real reduction in broken PDFs reaching the user.

## Customization

### Which files to edit manually

If you prefer editing files directly instead of using `/setup`:

| File | What to change |
|------|---------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Your full profile (name, education, experience, skills, goals) |
| `01-candidate-profile.md` | Structured version of your CV data |
| `02-behavioral-profile.md` | Your behavioral assessment or self-assessment |
| `04-job-evaluation.md` | Skill match areas, career goals, motivation filters |
| `05-cv-templates.md` | Profile statement templates for different role types |
| `07-interview-prep.md` | Your STAR examples from actual experience |

### LaTeX templates

The CV uses [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) (banking style). The cover letter uses a custom `cover.cls` with Lato/Raleway fonts. You can replace these with your own templates; just update the guidance in `05-cv-templates.md` and `06-cover-letter-templates.md`.

### Salary benchmarking

The salary tool works with any salary data you provide (union statistics, Glassdoor exports, personal research, etc.). See `tools/README_SALARY_TOOL.md` for the expected format and setup. If you don't have salary data, the salary step is simply skipped.

### Starting over

To wipe your profile data and start fresh:

```
/reset profile    # clears skill files, preserves framework rules
/reset documents  # deletes files from documents/ folder
/reset all        # both
```

`/reset` shows exactly what will be deleted and requires you to type `RESET` to confirm. Nothing is deleted until you do.

## Tips for better results

### Profile depth matters

The single biggest factor in output quality is how much detail you put into your profile. A thin profile produces generic applications; a detailed one enables genuinely tailored results.

- **Role descriptions:** Don't just list job titles. Describe what you actually did in each position: specific projects, tools used, responsibilities, and measurable achievements. The more material you provide, the more precisely the system can reframe your experience for different roles.
- **Skills in context:** Instead of listing "Python" or "project management," describe how and where you applied them. "Built ML pipelines for customer churn prediction in Python using scikit-learn" gives the system far more to work with than "Python, machine learning."
- **All onboarding paths work:** Whether you point `/setup` at your `documents/` folder, paste a single CV, or walk through the interview, the principle is the same: richer input produces sharper output.

### Career path discovery

The framework supports two distinct modes of job searching:

- **Explicit targeting:** You know which roles or sectors you want. The system helps refine and prioritize based on fit.
- **Latent opportunity discovery:** By analyzing your full history (not just job titles, but the actual work you did), the system can surface career paths you haven't considered. Transferable skills that map to unexpected industries, patterns in what you enjoyed or excelled at, or emerging roles that combine your domain expertise with new technology.

To get the most from this, invest time during `/setup` in describing not just your experience, but what energized you, what drained you, and what you'd want more of. This context directly shapes how the system evaluates fit and which roles it surfaces.
